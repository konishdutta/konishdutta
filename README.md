# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Konish.
I'm really passionate about the intersection of creativity and technology. Below you'll find a list of personal projects I've undertaken in my pursuit to a) deepen my understanding of computer science b) find an outlet to express my creative impulse.

| Project    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
|<A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61c_labs/tree/main/proj2"><B>MNIST Neural Network</B><img src="https://github.com/konishdutta/root/blob/main/neuralnet.PNG" alt="Neural Network" width="500"/></A>|I implemented a pre-trained neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, entirely in RISC-V assembly language. This not only deepened my understanding of machine learning fundamentals, but also honed my skills in low-level programming and optimization. Key achievements include the implementation of essential functions such as matrix multiplication, softmax, and ReLU, all while managing resources by optimizing register, stack, and heap usage.|

This project showcases **raycasting techniques** to simulate the propagation of light from various sources, creating an immersive experience. Through efficient vector and matrix manipulations, Theseus dynamically generates fields of view and calculates real-time lighting effects, all while maintaining high performance and visual fidelity.|
|<A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61c_labs/tree/main/proj1"><B>Conway's Game of Life Simulator</B></a><p><A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61c_labs/tree/main/proj1"><img src = "https://github.com/konishdutta/root/blob/main/game_of_life.gif" width = 200></A>|A simulator for Conway's Game of Life written in C. Runs 24 parallel simulations in 24-bit color space! I worked on this project to ramp up on file I/O, data structures, and algorithms in C.|
|<A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61b/tree/main/proj2"><B>Gitlet</B><img src="https://github.com/konishdutta/root/blob/main/git.webp" alt="Theseus" width="500"/></A>|A git clone written in Java from scratch. Demonstrates usage of data structures and algorithms tailored to a commercial application.|
|<A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61c_labs/blob/main/proj3"><B>2 & 5 Stage RISC-V CPU<img src = "https://github.com/konishdutta/konishdutta/assets/16747354/15830a89-269d-4234-be93-14ec01a66f8c"></B></A>|A 2-stage and 5-stage RISC-V CPU built in Logism to demonstrate understanding of CPU architecture and pipelining.|
