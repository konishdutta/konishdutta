|<A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61b/tree/main/proj3"><B>Theseus</B><img src="https://github.com/konishdutta/root/blob/main/theseus.webp" alt="Theseus" width="500"/></A>|Dive into the labyrinthine world of Theseus, a pseudo-random world-generation engine inspired by the legendary tale of Theseus, the Minotaur, and Ariadne's golden thread. This project showcases **raycasting techniques** to simulate the propagation of light from various sources, creating an immersive experience. Through efficient vector and matrix manipulations, Theseus dynamically generates fields of view and calculates real-time lighting effects, all while maintaining high performance and visual fidelity.|
| [Gitlet](https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61b/tree/main/proj2)  |A git clone written in Java from scratch. Demonstrates usage of data structures and algorithms tailored to a commercial application.|
