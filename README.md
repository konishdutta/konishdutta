# Welcome to Konish's Github!
ðŸ‘‹ I'm Konish. I'm really passionate about the intersection of creativity and technology. Below you'll find a list of personal projects I've undertaken in my pursuit to a) deepen my understanding of computer science b) find an outlet to express my creative impulse.

| Project    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
|<A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61b/tree/main/proj3"><B>Theseus</B><img src="https://github.com/konishdutta/root/blob/main/theseus.webp" alt="Theseus" width="500"/></A>|Dive into the labyrinthine world of Theseus, a pseudo-random world-generation engine inspired by the legendary tale of Theseus, the Minotaur, and Ariadne's golden thread. This project showcases **raycasting techniques** to simulate the propagation of light from various sources, creating an immersive experience. Through efficient vector and matrix manipulations, Theseus dynamically generates fields of view and calculates real-time lighting effects, all while maintaining high performance and visual fidelity.|
|<A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61c_labs/tree/main/proj1"><B>Conway's Game of Life Simulator</B><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konishdutta/root/main/game_of_life.gif" alt="Game of Life" width="500"/></A>|A simulator for Conway's Game of Life written in C. Runs 24 parallel simulations in 24-bit color space! I worked on this project to ramp up on file I/O, data structures, and algorithms in C.|
|<A HREF="https://github.com/konishdutta/cs61b/tree/main/proj2"><B>Gitlet</B><img src="https://github.com/konishdutta/root/blob/main/git.webp" alt="Theseus" width="500"/></A>|A git clone written in Java from scratch. Demonstrates usage of data structures and algorithms tailored to a commercial application.|
